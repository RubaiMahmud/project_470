## Installation (macOS / Linux)
1. Clone repository:
   ```
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd music_app_backup
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If you don't have `requirements.txt`, install:
   ```
   pip install flask pymongo gridfs flask-login python-dotenv werkzeug
   ```
4. Ensure MongoDB is running and reachable via MONGO_URI.
5. Run the app:
   ```
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   flask run
   ```
   Or:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
6. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

## Usage notes
- Login / registration handled via flask-login; admin users have elevated routes.
- Audio assets are streamed from GridFS. When uploading songs, the file is stored into GridFS 

## Admin and data management
- Admin routes allow uploading songs, adding artists and albums, and editing metadata.
- Ensure uploaded files conform to allowed extensions defined in `config.py`:
  - Audio: mp3, flac, wav
  - Images: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, webp, svg

## Testing / Development tips
- Use a development copy of MongoDB for testing.
- To seed the DB, either use the admin UI or write a small script to insert documents and store files in GridFS.
- For debugging, consult the Flask terminal output and the browser DevTools console.

## Troubleshooting
- Module import error for flask-login:
  ```
  pip install flask_login
  ```
- MongoDB connection issues: check `MONGO_URI` and that mongod is running.
- Audio not playing: verify GridFS storage and that returned file routes stream bytes correctly.
- flask-login user loader errors: ensure `models.MongoDB.init_app` sets `users_collection` and `mongo_db` is initialized before login_manager is used.

## Contributing
- Fork and create focused PRs.
- Include tests for new logic where practical.
- Keep UI/style changes separate from backend logic changes for easier review.

## Security & Privacy
- Do not commit secrets to the repository. Use `.env` for secret keys and connection strings.
- Validate uploaded files and sanitize metadata inputs.
